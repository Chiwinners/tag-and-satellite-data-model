# docs/

Documentation artifacts for the project:

- `img/` â€” diagrams, figures, and screenshots used in README and reports.
- Future additions: architecture diagrams, data flow charts, modeling figures.

Use `tree.txt` (generated at repo root) to embed a clean structure snapshot in documentation.
